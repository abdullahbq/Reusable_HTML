In HTML, reusable elements typically refer to HTML elements that can be used multiple times throughout a document or across different documents. These elements are defined once and can be included wherever needed, promoting code reusability and maintainability. There are a few ways to achieve reusability in HTML:

### Custom Elements (Web Components):
With the introduction of Web Components, you can create your own custom HTML elements that encapsulate functionality and styling. Custom elements allow you to define new tags with associated JavaScript logic and CSS styles. They are designed to be reusable and can be easily included in different parts of your HTML.

#### Example of defining a custom element:

```html
<script>
    class MyCustomElement extends HTMLElement {
        constructor() {
            super();
            // Your element's logic goes here
        }
    }

    customElements.define('my-custom-element', MyCustomElement);
</script>
```

Usage in html file
```
<my-custom-element></my-custom-element>

```
